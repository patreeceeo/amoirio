I'd like to put it out there that I'm working on a video game as my submission to the sellout show. The basic idea is to turn Super Mario Bros on its head, that is, you control the army of Koupas trying to stop Mario from stealing your sacred fungi. I've developed some lore that connects it to the sellout theme. I'm working with a friend on programming and game design. Let me know if anyone wants to collab on programming, art, writing, chip tune music or game design (listed in order of biggest need) When it comes to programming, we're basing it off of https://github.com/itsMapleLeaf/super-mario-typescript
